# Note

This is roughly based on https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian but much more stripped down and simplified. I was unable to get that
repo actually working but I just started grabbing some of the /commands from it to start with.

This is only an example / reference. These files are not updated because they are largely managed in the Vault itself and I am avoiding
complicated symlink setups. Vault should be sync'd and otherwise backed up separately from these dotfiles but I wanted to capture the
basic concepts of this new workflow here.
