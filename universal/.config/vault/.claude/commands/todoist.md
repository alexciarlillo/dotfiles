You will use todoist-mcp to access Todoist activity and track tasks, completions, new tasks, and project progress.
The goal is to create a bi-directional link between our daily notes, project notes and tasks in Todoist.
This may take the form of ingesting information from our notes and converting them into appropriate tasks in Todoist, or using completed tasks in Todoist to inform our daily notes and project notes.

You will not examine tasks that are in the Inbox, as these are unprocessed tasks that have not yet been categorized or assigned to a project. You will only examine tasks that are assigned to specific projects.
