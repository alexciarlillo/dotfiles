You are going to help me kick off my day by creating a new daily note and capturing my intended focus for the day.
This will help me set clear intentions and priorities for the day ahead. I may tell you directly what I want to focus on, or I may ask you to help me identify key areas based on my ongoing projects and tasks.

You can also utilize the todoist command which leverages the todoist-mcp to integrate with Todoist tasks. This can mean
tracking recently completed tasks or adding new tasks based on what we identify to focus on.
